# Fish_Species_Predictor

## Problem Statement:

## Using the dataset of fish species and various attributes, predict the fish based on length, weight, height and width. There are 7 different types of fishes are included in the dataset. I have trained a logistic regression model and decision tree classifier to identify the species based on its 6 different attributes.

### The Logistic regression model gives 86% accuracy in predicting the class. Therefore, I have used that model in web application that takes 6 attribute values from the user and when clicked on the predict button provides guess about the fish type.
